# PATTERN, PROCESS AND MECHANISM - THE FUNDAMENTALS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY APPLIED TO VEGETATION SCIENCE
https://www.jstor.org/stable/43461130#metadata_info_tab_contents

Pattern = WHAT. observation [defined with a specific purpose in mind], e.g. the traitspace volume
Process = HOW. operations or actions generating the pattern. Or sometimes just pattern through time?
Mechanism = WHY. fundamental process resposible for action, reaction or other phenomenon. Or sometimes just process?

Pattern is the descriptor and process the function. E.g. for any f(x), x is describing the pattern at the moment of the observation (e.g. where is x) and f() is the function/process allowing to know where x is. The mechanism is then how a specific function (here f()) can be used to explain the observation of the pattern (x).
  
"pattern recognition [which] can be regarded as a precursor or limiting factor in the pursuit of understanding"
"pattern is "the zero-dimensional characteristic of a set of points which describes the location of these points in terms of the relative distances of one point to another" (Upton and Fingleton 1985)"

# Modeling: Neutral, Null, and Baseline

Null is maybe not the right term. Maybe it's just testing the process of interest.

# Revisiting the Holy Grail: using plant functional traits to understand ecological processes
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12275

Outstanding questions (in 2016): (i) selecting relevant traits; (ii) describing intraspecific trait variation and incorporating this variation into models; and (iii) scaling trait data to community- and ecosystem-level processes.

# Let the concept of trait be functional!
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15559.x

Discussing what traits should (could) or should not be.
“Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. 

# HOW DO DIFFERENT MEASURES OF FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY PERFORM?
https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/03-0226

Looking with field experiement the difference between two metrics: FAD = (`c(sum,pairwise.dit)`) sum of the distances between species in trait space; FD = (`c(sum, span.tree.length)`ish) total branch length of the functional dendrogram that results from clustering the species in trait space.
Different metrics, different results.

# The dimensionality and structure of species trait spaces
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13778

Great work on assessing the quality of the trait space
Three key aspects:
- dimensionality issue: how many dimensions?
- choice of traits: which traits?
- species distribution in trait space: where are things?

# Assessing functional diversity: the influence of the number of the functional traits
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12080-019-00433-x

Checking what the metrics capture (moms style). But maybe no link with mechanism?
Effect of traits on pattern recovery:
With a Euclidean approach:
Functional richness (FRic- TOP - HYPE) increases with the number of traits
Functional evenness (FEve - Ru) is constant
Functional divergence is variable (FDiv is constant; FDis, FSpe and Q are increasing with the number of traits)
With a Gower approach:
Functional richness (FRic- TOP - HYPE) decreases with the number of traits
Functional evenness (FEve - Ru) is constant
Functional divergence is variable (FDiv is constant; FDis, FSpe and Q are decreasing with the number of traits)

FRic =  Convex Hull Volume. Amount of functional space filled by the community. 
TOP= TOP index (Fontana et al. 2015):  Sum of successive convex hull area. Density of functional space filled by the community. 
HYPE = n-hypervolume index (Blonder 2014):  Level of functional space filled by the community 
FEve =  Sum of MST branch length (l) weighted by relative abundance. 
Ru = Ru (Ricotta et al. 2014): Regularity with which species are distributed along the tree, together with the evenness in their abundances
FDiv =  Species deviance from the mean distance to the centre of gravity weighted by relative abundance. 
Fdis =  FDis (Laliberté and Legendre 2010):  Mean distance of individual species to the centroid of all species to the community. 
Q = (quadratic entropy of Rao, Botta-Dukát 2005):  Sum of pairwise distances between species weighted by relative abundance. 
FSpe (Villéger et al. 2010):  Euclidean distance of species to the centre of gravity of all the species weighted by relative abundance.
