# PATTERN, PROCESS AND MECHANISM - THE FUNDAMENTALS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY APPLIED TO VEGETATION SCIENCE
https://www.jstor.org/stable/43461130#metadata_info_tab_contents

Pattern = WHAT. observation [defined with a specific purpose in mind], e.g. the traitspace volume
Process = HOW. operations or actions generating the pattern. Or sometimes just pattern through time?
Mechanism = WHY. fundamental process resposible for action, reaction or other phenomenon. Or sometimes just process?

Pattern is the descriptor and process the function. E.g. for any f(x), x is describing the pattern at the moment of the observation (e.g. where is x) and f() is the function/process allowing to know where x is. The mechanism is then how a specific function (here f()) can be used to explain the observation of the pattern (x).
  
"pattern recognition [which] can be regarded as a precursor or limiting factor in the pursuit of understanding"
"pattern is "the zero-dimensional characteristic of a set of points which describes the location of these points in terms of the relative distances of one point to another" (Upton and Fingleton 1985)"

# Modeling: Neutral, Null, and Baseline

Null is maybe not the right term. Maybe it's just testing the process of interest.

# Revisiting the Holy Grail: using plant functional traits to understand ecological processes
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12275

Outstanding questions (in 2016): (i) selecting relevant traits; (ii) describing intraspecific trait variation and incorporating this variation into models; and (iii) scaling trait data to community- and ecosystem-level processes.

# Let the concept of trait be functional!
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15559.x

Discussing what traits should (could) or should not be.
“Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. 

# HOW DO DIFFERENT MEASURES OF FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY PERFORM?
https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/03-0226

Looking with field experiement the difference between two metrics: FAD = (`c(sum,pairwise.dit)`) sum of the distances between species in trait space; FD = (`c(sum, span.tree.length)`ish) total branch length of the functional dendrogram that results from clustering the species in trait space.
Different metrics, different results.

# The dimensionality and structure of species trait spaces
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.13778

Great work on assessing the quality of the trait space
Three key aspects:
- dimensionality issue: how many dimensions?
- choice of traits: which traits?
- species distribution in trait space: where are things?

# Assessing functional diversity: the influence of the number of the functional traits
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12080-019-00433-x

Checking what the metrics capture (moms style). But maybe no link with mechanism?
Effect of traits on pattern recovery:
With a Euclidean approach:
Functional richness (FRic- TOP - HYPE) increases with the number of traits
Functional evenness (FEve - Ru) is constant
Functional divergence is variable (FDiv is constant; FDis, FSpe and Q are increasing with the number of traits)
With a Gower approach:
Functional richness (FRic- TOP - HYPE) decreases with the number of traits
Functional evenness (FEve - Ru) is constant
Functional divergence is variable (FDiv is constant; FDis, FSpe and Q are decreasing with the number of traits)

FRic =  Convex Hull Volume. Amount of functional space filled by the community. 
TOP= TOP index (Fontana et al. 2015):  Sum of successive convex hull area. Density of functional space filled by the community. 
HYPE = n-hypervolume index (Blonder 2014):  Level of functional space filled by the community 
FEve =  Sum of MST branch length (l) weighted by relative abundance. 
Ru = Ru (Ricotta et al. 2014): Regularity with which species are distributed along the tree, together with the evenness in their abundances
FDiv =  Species deviance from the mean distance to the centre of gravity weighted by relative abundance. 
Fdis =  FDis (Laliberté and Legendre 2010):  Mean distance of individual species to the centroid of all species to the community. 
Q = (quadratic entropy of Rao, Botta-Dukát 2005):  Sum of pairwise distances between species weighted by relative abundance. 
FSpe (Villéger et al. 2010):  Euclidean distance of species to the centre of gravity of all the species weighted by relative abundance.

# To harness traits for ecology, let’s abandon ‘functionality’
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534722002890

Focusing on traits that are "Functional" can be narrowing the field and is probably subjective. Traits can be more than functional or not functional at all and still useful for understanding stuff. We need a broader definition of traits? Or no definition at all. Like make the definition question based.

In a way that makes me think of the "niche" or "species" concept. I think it's rather precise and clear in some cases (e.g. clear/specific niche = photosynthesis type + nitrogen use in plants; clear specific species = a flamingo and a darwin finch used for comparative data). But it other cases they are not clear (and it's OK; e.g. scavenger niche; a tree distribution with n taxa and different topologies for comparative analyses).

# How to improve scaling from traits to ecosystem processes
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534722002749

This one is kind of the opposite of the above paper: we need to have a narrower and more precise definition of functional ecology and stuff to understand how to link patterns > processes > mechanisms

# Animal functional traits: Towards a trait-based ecology for whole ecosystems

 * We need more traits based on animals than plants - sure... 











> In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time.
> Biodiversity can influence ecosystem functioning through changes in the amount of resource use complementary among species
> Trait-based ecology aims to understand the processes that generate the overarching diversity of organismal traits and their influence on ecosystem functioning. 
> The impact of the variation of the number of functional traits on functional diversity assessment is still poorly known
> Trait based ecology has developed fast in the last decades, aiming to both explain mechanisms of community assembly, and predict patterns in nature, such as the effects of biodiversity shifts on key ecosystem processes.
> Ecosystems simultaneously deliver multiple functions that relate to both the activities of resident species and environmental conditions. 
> Analysis of functional diversity, based on plant traits and community structure, provides a promising approach for exploration of the adaptive strategies of plants and the relationship between plant traits and ecosystem functioning.
> Functional traits and associated trait-based concepts have driven rapid innovation in ecology over recent years, with most progress based on insights from plants.
