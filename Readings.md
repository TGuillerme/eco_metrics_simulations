# PATTERN, PROCESS AND MECHANISM - THE FUNDAMENTALS OF SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY APPLIED TO VEGETATION SCIENCE
https://www.jstor.org/stable/43461130#metadata_info_tab_contents

Pattern = WHAT. observation [defined with a specific purpose in mind], e.g. the traitspace volume
Process = HOW. operations or actions generating the pattern. Or sometimes just pattern through time?
Mechanism = WHY. fundamental process resposible for action, reaction or other phenomenon. Or sometimes just process?

Pattern is the descriptor and process the function. E.g. for any f(x), x is describing the pattern at the moment of the observation (e.g. where is x) and f() is the function/process allowing to know where x is. The mechanism is then how a specific function (here f()) can be used to explain the observation of the pattern (x).
  
"pattern recognition [which] can be regarded as a precursor or limiting factor in the pursuit of understanding"
"pattern is "the zero-dimensional characteristic of a set of points which describes the location of these points in terms of the relative distances of one point to another" (Upton and Fingleton 1985)"

# Modeling: Neutral, Null, and Baseline

Null is maybe not the right term. Maybe it's just testing the process of interest.

Outstanding questions (in 2016): (i) selecting relevant traits; (ii) describing intraspecific trait variation and incorporating this variation into models; and (iii) scaling trait data to community- and ecosystem-level processes.

# Let the concept of trait be functional!

Discussing what traits should (could) or should not be.
“Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance.
