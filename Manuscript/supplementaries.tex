\caption{\scriptsize{\textbf{Simulation results for 2 dimensions:} the y axes represent the different metrics tested (sorted by categories).
The different columns represent the different stressors. The x-axes represent the metric values centred on the random changes and scaled by the maximum value for each metric between the four stressors.
Negative and positive values signify that the metric score for the stressor of interest is lower/higher than the one from the random stressor.
The dots represent the median metric value, the full line their 50\% confidence interval (CI) and the dashed line their 95\% CI.
The colours are here to visually separate the metrics by categories (blue = regularity, yellow = divergence, green = richness); the colour gradient within each row corresponds to a removal of respectively 80\%, 60\%, 40\% and 20\% of the data (from top to bottom).
The grey line plots represent distributions of metric scores not clearly distinguishable from the random metric scores (paired t-test p value $> 0.05$).
Grey lines in the background across the distributions of different removal amounts represent the fitted linear model centred and scaled metric score $\sim$ amount of data removed and the value displayed is the adjusted $R^2$ from each of these models.
Dashed thin grey lines represent non-significant models (p value of slope or/and intercept $> 0.05$).

The plot shows that although 4 dimensions are enough to describe at least 95\% of the variance for the extant group, 5 dimensions are required for the pre-1500 group (following the method proposed in \cite{guillerme2023innovation}).
